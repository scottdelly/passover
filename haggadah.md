# A Modern Passover

*For those who want to remember, for those who want to take stock, for those who want to be thankful, and for those who want to get to the meal faster.*

## Invitation

**Reader 1**: We have come together this evening for many reasons. We are here because Spring is all around, the Earth is reborn, and it is a good time to celebrate with family and friends. 

**Together:** *We are here because the struggle for freedom never stops. We are here to remember all those who are not free.*

**Reader 2**: We welcome the warmth and light of Spring. We rejoice in the rich blessings of this season. 

**Reader 3**: *The light of these candles symbolizes a renewal of life, a reaffirmation of freedom.*

**Family Matron**: [Light candles before the prayer]

ברוך אתה א-דני א-להינו מלך העולם, אשר קדשנו במצותיו, וצונו להדליק נר של שבת קדש

**Together**: *Baruch Atah Ado-nai, Elo-heinu Melech Ha-olam, Asher Kid’shanu B’mitzvotav V’tzivanu L’hadlik Ner Shel Yom Tov*

## Kadesh — Kiddush, the first cup of wine
### Blessing the wine at the start of the meal

(It is preferred that each participant's cup should be poured by someone else to symbolize the majesty of the evening, as though each participant had a servant. The cup should be filled to the brim)

**Reader 1**: Let us all fill our glasses with wine... Spring is the season of new growth and new life. Every living thing must either grow, or die; growth is a sign and a condition of life. 

**Reader 2**: We grow as we achieve new insights, new knowledge, and new goals. Let us raise our cups to signify our gratitude for life, and for the joy of knowing inner growth, which gives human life its meaning.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן

**Together**: *Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, borei p’ri hagafen.*

## Urhatz – Wash, Hand Washing

[Each participant should wash their hands if they have not]

## Karpas — Spring vegetable
Any vegetable that is not bitter may be eaten. Common vegetables used are celery, parsley, onion, or potato. Dipped in salt water for purification and seasoning they remind us of the vegetation of spring, or the baby boys cast in the Nile, or the tears shed by the slaves.

## Yahatz — Divide, Breaking the middle matzah
Break the middle matzah into two parts. It should be broken by hand rather than cut since such is the way of the poor. Take larger part, wrap it in napkin and save for the conclusion of the meal. Try — but not too hard — to keep it from being stolen by the children because it must be available for the end of the meal.

## Magid — Narrate

**Host**: [Fill the wine cups]

### The Seder Plate
```
Zeroah: A Roasted Bone
A cooked thigh or neck of a chicken, broiled a little over the fire, comes in memory of the Paschal lamb. We call it z'roah (arm) to remind us of the outstretched hand with which G-d delivered the Jewish people from bondage.
```
```
Beitzah: A hard-boiled Egg
A hard boiled egg, broiled over the fire, reminds us of the offering in honor of the Yom Tov, Korbon Chagiga, which Jews were required to bring when the Bais Hamikdosh existed. An egg is used because it is a food eaten by mourners, and the day on which the first night of Pesach falls coincides with the day on which the ninth of Av comes out. Also beitzah in Aramaic (pronounced beyah) means "“want" or "desire", thus the egg on the Seder plate implies the "desire" of G-d to deliver His people.
```
```
Maror: Bitter Herbs
These bitter herbs symbolize the harsh suffering and bitter times we endured when we were slaves in Egypt.
```
```
Charoset:
Charoset resembles bricks and mortar, reminding us how hard we were forced to work when we were slaves in Egypt.

A mixture of apples, filberts, ginger, and red wine. Apples are used because the Jewish mothers went to give birth outside the city under apple trees so as not to be detected by the Egyptian task masters. Filberts are used because the Jewish people are compared (in Shir HaShirim) to a garden of filberts. Ginger reminds us of the mortar that the Jewish people used for making the bricks with which they built the Egyptian cities. The red wine reminds us of the blood of the infants that were hurled into the Nile by the Egyptians. The Charoses should be thick, to remember the mortar, but before dipping the morror in Charoses, we make the Charoses more liquefied by adding a little more red wine.
```
```
Karpas: This can be a small slice of onion, boiled potato or sprigs of parsley. We dip the Karpas into salt water at the beginning of the Seder, representing the salty tears we cried when we were slaves.
```
```
Chazeret: More Bitter Herbs
This is the second portion of bitter herbs which we eat during the Seder. This is eaten in a Matzah sandwich together with Maror. 
```
```
Salt Water
We dip the Karpas into the salt water to remind us that the Jews crossed the Red Sea.
```
```
Orange
A gesture of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, and all those who are marginalized within the broader community 
```

On all other nights, we eat either sitting or leaning. Why, on this night, do we eat while leaning? 
```

## Answering The 4 Questions
**Reader 1**: Let's answer the questions, one by one. 

**Reader 2**: Matzah--Why do we eat matzah? 

**Together**: *Matzah is the symbol of our affliction and our freedom.*

**Reader 3**: Legend has it that when Moses and his followers fled Egypt, they moved so quickly that the bread they baked did not have time to rise. 

**Reader 4**: However, scholars have noted that long before the Jews celebrated Passover, farmers of the Middle East celebrated KhagHa-matzot, the festival of unleavened bread, at this time of year. This was a festival where unleavened bread was made from the new grain harvest that took place at this time of the year. 

**Reader 5**: The old fermented dough was thrown out so that last year's grain would not be mixed with this year's. Therefore, the new season began with the eating of unleavened bread--matzah. Later on, the Jewish people incorporated this agricultural festival into the celebration of freedom and renewal we now call Passover. 

**Reader 2**: Maror--Why do we eat maror, the bitter herb? 

**Together**: *Tradition says that this root is to remind us of the time of our slavery. We force ourselves to taste pain so that we may more readily value pleasure.* 

**Reader 4**: Scholars inform us that bitter herbs were eaten at the Spring festival in ancient times. The sharpness of the taste awakened the senses and made the people feel at one with nature's revival. Thus, maror is the stimulus of life, reminding us that struggle is better than the complacent acceptance of injustice. 

**Reader 2**: Salt Water--Why do we dip our food in salt water two times on this night? 

**Reader 3**: The first time, the salty taste reminds us of the tears we cried when we were slaves. 

**Reader 5**: The second time, the salt water reminds us of when we crossed the red sea.

**Reader 2**: Leaning--Why do we eat while leaning on this night? 

**Reader 4**: This goes back to ancient times in Rome, when it was the custom for rich people to eat while lying on a couch leaning on one elbow as slaves and servants fed them. The Jewish people thought of this relaxed type of eating as a sign of freedom and prosperity, so they would lean to one side eating at the Seder on Passover, the festival of freedom. Today, we who are free eat while sitting up, even at Passover, but the question remains in the service as a reminder of how it was when our people longed for freedom.


## The Four Sons

## The Ten Plagues

**Reader 2**: Since our cup cannot be regarded as full when we recall the suffering of the Egyptians, a drop of wine is removed from the cup with the mention of each plague.

[As each plague is named, everyone dips a finger in wine and then touches a plate to remove the drop.]

**Together**: *Blood, Frogs, Gnats, Flies, Cattle Disease, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, Death of the Firstborn.* 

**Reader 4**: In the same spirit, our celebration today is also shadowed by our awareness of continuing sorrow and oppression in all parts of the world. Ancient plagues are mirrored in modern tragedies. 

**Reader 2**: We are a worldly people, living in many lands and among many nations. The power of science has shrunk our planet and has made all of us the children of one human family. We are all victims together of enormous social problems. We share in their effects and in the responsibility to overcome them. 

**Reader 1**: We spill wine from our cups at the mention of each of these contemporary plagues. We cannot allow ourselves to drink a full measure since our own lives are sobered by these ills, which darken our lives and diminish our joy. As the pain of others diminishes our joys, let us once more diminish the wine of our festival as we repeat the names of these modern plagues: 

**Group**: *Hunger, War, Crime, Disease, Racism, Abuse, Poverty, Homophobia, Pollution, Indifference to suffering.* 

**Reader 1**: May there be peace, kindness, happiness, and compassion. 

**Reader 1**: Just as the food of our Passover supper will nourish our bodies, so the experience of the human spirit gives meaning to our lives. As a full expression of the hope and joy of this combination, we say Dayenu. 

**Around the table:**
```
If He had brought us out from Egypt,
and had not carried out judgments against them
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had carried out judgments against them,
and not against their idols
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had destroyed their idols,
and had not smitten their first-born
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had smitten their first-born,
and had not given us their wealth
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us their wealth,
and had not split the sea for us
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had split the sea for us,
and had not taken us through it on dry land
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had taken us through the sea on dry land,
and had not drowned our oppressors in it
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had drowned our oppressors in it,
and had not supplied our needs in the desert for forty years
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had supplied our needs in the desert for forty years,
and had not fed us the manna
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had fed us the manna,
and had not given us the Shabbat
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us the Shabbat,
and had not brought us before Mount Sinai
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had brought us before Mount Sinai,
and had not given us the Torah	v'lo
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us the Torah,
and had not brought us into the land of Israel
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had brought us into the land of Israel,
and not built for us the Holy Temple
```
**All Say:** Dayenu

## The second cup of wine

**Reader 4**: “Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time: the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence. Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” — Martin Luther King Jr, Nobel Prize Speech 1964.

**Reader 1**: The second cup of wine is dedicated not only to the struggles of the Jewish people, but to all people seeking a secure life free of fear and persecution. In particular, may the Israelis and the Palestinians come to enjoy freedom and peace. For, as the prophet Isaiah said:

**Together**: *They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again know war.* 

[Drink second cup of wine]

## The Story Of Passover

**Reader 1**: Passover is a celebration of Life. Despite many centuries of destruction our hearts are tempered by the knowledge that the world can also be good. We have endured slavery and genocide. But we have also enjoyed freedom and power. 

**Together:** *We have learned to endure. We have learned to progress.*

**Reader 2**: It is said that long ago, during a time of famine, the ancient Israelites traveled to Egypt. According to this legend, the Israelites at that time were all in a single family - Jacob and his children. 
 
**Reader 3**: One of Jacob's sons was Joseph. He was so wise that the ruler of Egypt - the Pharaoh - made Joseph a leader over all the people of Egypt.
 
**Reader 2**: But as time passed, another Pharaoh became the ruler of Egypt. He did not remember about Joseph and his wise leadership. This new Pharaoh turned the Israelites into slaves.
 
**Reader 3**: After the Israelites were in Egypt for over 400 years, a man arose among them. He demanded that Pharaoh let his people go! Many times he risked his life to insist on the freedom of his people, until he finally succeeded. 
 
**Reader 4**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and the people he led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We celebrate the struggle of all people to be free.  Throughout the centuries, the story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt has inspired Jews and non-Jews in times of persecution and hardship. 
 
**Together**: *Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people.* 

## Passover and Freedom

**Reader 1**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and Miriam and the people they led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We remember the struggle of all people to be free. 

**Reader 4**: Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people. Many centuries after the time of Moses, African people were brought to America as slaves. The freedom we celebrate tonight is not only freedom from slavery. It is also the freedom to live in peace, with dignity and with hope for a bright future.

**Reader 1**: We are here tonight celebrating this festival of freedom in a free land. 

**Reader 2**: This evening, as we celebrate our own freedom, be aware of the struggle for freedom in many other parts of the world. 

**Reader 4**: “When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always.” — Gandhi

## Rohtza — Wash
Ready to eat, the hands are washed before the meal, as is required at any meal.

## Motzi Matzah — Eating Matzah
The first food at the meal is the matzah, the unleavened bread. The usual blessing over bread, Hamotzi, is recited. However, before eating the matzah, a second blessing thanking God for the requirement to eat matzah is recited.

## Maror — Bitter Herbs
Small pieces of horseradish are dipped into haroset (a sweet paste symbolic of mortar) to indicate that overemphasis on material things results in bitterness. Some people mix ground horseradish with charoset. Do not recline while eating the marror.

## Korekh — Hillel Sandwich
In ancient times, the Talmudic scholar Hillel ate the three symbolic foods (lamb, matzah, and bitter herbs) together so that each mouthful contained all three. Thus the symbols of slavery and liberation were intermingled. Now that we do not have the Paschal lamb, we eat just the matzah and horseradish in a “Hillel sandwich.” No special blessing is said, but we do read the words recalling Hillel’s practice.

## The third cup of wine

**Host**: [Fill the wine glasses]

**Reader 2**: During this festival of life, it is important for us to remember our lost sisters and brothers--the millions who died, alone and friendless, victims of genocide. Their anguish and death must be with us, even in our times of celebration. 

**Together**: *Their memory shall not be lost.* 

**Reader 3**: We drink the third cup of wine to those who were taken from us and to those who fought for freedom and life.

[Drink third cup of wine]

## Shulhan Orekh — Meal
The joyous feasting gives us the feeling of human fellowship in harmony with God. Many have the custom to begin the meal by eating the egg from the Seder Plate. No roast meat may be eaten this night, not even roasted chicken. Even pot roast is forbidden. But roast fish and roasted eggs are permitted. In some places the custom is to eat eggs, but this is not obligatory. Some people's custom is not to eat any dish that involves dipping in a sauce, so as to fulfill precisely what it says in the Four Questions, that we dip food twice this night (and no more).

If someone falls asleep in the middle of the meal, even just for a few minutes, he must wash his hands again when he wakes up (without a brocha), but he may still eat the Afikomen, and he need not make another Hamotzi over it. It is important not to doze off against the pillow in which the afikomen is hidden, so as to avoid any question of the afikomen having become like food that was put under a bed.

## Tzafun — Dessert
Now the afikomen. Either someone has “stolen” it, or parents can hide the afikoman when it is first put aside (Step 4) and let the children look for it during the meal to win a prize. Eaten in memory of the Pesach sacrifice which was served at the end of the meal. All efforts should be made to assure that the afikomen is eaten before midnight.

## Barekh — Grace After Meals (Birkat Hamazon)
This is the usual “bentschen,” grace after meals, including, of course, thankfulness for the Passover holiday. Fill the cup before this grace and drink the third cup at its conclusion, with the usual “bore p’ri hagafen” blessing.

At this point in the seder, we open the door For Elijah, who by tradition is the forerunner of the Messiah, the harbinger of hope. Sing “Eliyahu Ha-navi.”

## The cup of Elijah

**Host**: [Filll the wine cups and a cup for Elijah and Ruth]

This is the cup of Elijah. Legend says that Elijah was a brave man who denounced the slavery of his day. He is a symbol of peace and freedom. 

It was customary during the Passover Seder to open the door of the house for Elijah, in the hope that the age of universal peace may soon be at hand. 

**Group**: *We, too, open the door to peace, knowing that Elijah's task is really our own. Only when we have made a world where nation shall not lift up sword against nation, where justice is universal, and where each person is free, will the age-old dream of peace be real.*

*Let us bring peace and justice to the world!*

**Host**: [Open a door for Elijah]

[Drink 4th Glass Of Wine]

## Hallel — Psalms of Praise
The rest of the evening is given over to hymns and songs. The Hallel is completed, and all join in singing songs: Adir Hu, Had Gadya, etc.

## Nirtzah — Conclusion 
With the traditional formula, the seder is concluded, and the we sing L’Shana HaBa’ah B’Y’rushalayim [Next Year in Jerusalem].
