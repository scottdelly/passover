## Invitation

**Reader 1**: We have come together this evening for many reasons. We are here because Spring is all around, the Earth is reborn, and it is a good time to celebrate with family and friends. 

**Group:** *We are here because the struggle for human freedom never stops. We are here to remember all people who are still struggling for their freedom.*

**Reader 2**: We welcome the warmth and light of Spring. We rejoice in the warm light and rich blessings of this season. 

**Group**: *The light of these candles symbolizes a renewal of life, a reaffirmation of freedom.*

[Light candles]

**Group**: *Baruch Atah Ado-nai, Elo-heinu Melech Ha-olam, Asher Kid’shanu B’mitzvotav V’tzivanu L’hadlik Ner Shel Yom Tov*


## Kiddush, the first cup of wine

**Reader 1**: Let us all fill our glasses with wine... Spring is the season of new growth and new life. Every living thing must either grow, or die; growth is a sign and a condition of life. 

**Reader 2**: Like no other creature, the most significant growth for a human being takes place inwardly. We grow as we achieve new insights, new knowledge, new goals. Let us raise our cups to signify our gratitude for life, and for the joy of knowing inner growth, which gives human life its meaning. And with raised cups, together let us say: 

**Group**: *Peace to everyone.* 

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן 
**Group**: *Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, borei p’ri hagafen.*

## The Story Of Passover

**Reader 1**: Passover is the celebration of Life. Despite many centuries of memories of destruction our hearts are tempered by the knowledge that the world can also be good. We have endured slavery and humiliation. But we have also enjoyed freedom and power. 

**Group:** *We have learned to endure. We have learned to progress. We don’t just survive, we live, and we thrive.*

**Reader 2**: It is written that long ago, during a time of famine, the ancient Israelites traveled to Egypt. According to this legend, the Israelites at that time were all in a single family - Jacob and his children. 
 
**Reader 3**: One of Jacob's sons was Joseph. He was so wise that the ruler of Egypt - the Pharaoh - made Joseph a leader over all the people of Egypt. 
 
**Reader 1**: But as time passed, another Pharaoh became the ruler of Egypt. He did not remember about Joseph and his wise leadership. This new Pharaoh turned the Israelites into slaves, and burdened them with heavy work and sorrow. 
 
**Reader 2**: After the Israelites were in Egypt for over 400 years, a man arose among them. He demanded that Pharaoh let his people go! Many times he risked his life to insist on the freedom of his people, until he finally succeeded. 
 
**Reader 3**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and the people he led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We celebrate the struggle of all people to be free.  Throughout the centuries, the story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt has inspired Jews and non-Jews in times of persecution and hardship. 
 
**Group**: *Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people.*

## Passover and Freedom

**Reader 1**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and Miriam and the people they led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We remember the struggle of all people to be free. 

**Group**: *Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people. Many centuries after the time of Moses, African people were brought to America as slaves.*

*The freedom we celebrate tonight is not only freedom from slavery. It is also the freedom to live in peace, with dignity and with hope for a bright future.* 

**Reader 1**: We are here tonight celebrating this festival of freedom in a free land. 

**Reader 2**: This evening, as we celebrate this [our own] freedom let us take notice of the struggles toward freedom in many other parts of the world. 

**Reader 1**: “When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always.” — Gandhi

## Spilling The Wine

**Reader 1**: Let us all fill our cups with wine... Tonight we drink four cups of the fruit of the vine. There are many explanations for this custom. They represent, some have said, the four corners of the earth, for freedom must live everywhere; the four seasons of the year, for freedom's cycle must last through all the seasons; 

**Reader 2**: Let us diminish the wine in our cups as we recall the ten plagues that befell the Egyptian people. 

[As each plague is named, everyone dips a finger in wine and then touches a plate to remove the drop.]

**Group**: *Blood, Frogs, Gnats, Flies, Cattle Disease, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, Death of the Firstborn.* 

**Reader 3**: In the same spirit, our celebration today is also shadowed by our awareness of continuing sorrow and oppression in all parts of the world. Ancient plagues are mirrored in modern tragedies. 

**Reader 2**: We are a world people, living in many lands and among many nations. The power of science has shrunk our planet and has made all of us the children of one human family. We are all victims together of enormous social problems. We share in their effects and in the responsibility to overcome them. 

**Reader 1**: We spill wine from our cups at the mention of each of these contemporary plagues. We cannot allow ourselves to drink a full measure since our own lives are sobered by these ills, which darken our lives and diminish our joy. As the pain of others diminishes our joys, let us once more diminish the wine of our festival as we repeat the names of these modern plagues: 

**Group**: *Hunger, War, Crime, Disease, Racism, Abuse, Poverty, Homophobia, Pollution, Indifference to human suffering.* 

**Reader 1**: May there be peace, kindness, happiness, and compassion. 

## The second cup of wine

**Reader 1**: The second cup of wine is dedicated not only to the struggles of the Jewish people, but to all people seeking a secure life free of fear and persecution. In particular, may the Israelis and the Palestinians come to enjoy freedom and peace. For, as the prophet Isaiah said: 

**Group**: *They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again know war. But they shall sit every one under their vines and fig trees, and none shall make them afraid.* 

**Reader 1**: Let us all hold up our glasses of wine. 

“Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time: the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence. Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” — Martin Luther King Jr, Nobel Prize Speech 1964.

**Group**: *We are awed by all life in the world. How beautiful is the life of humankind.* 

**Reader 1**: Now let us all drink our second cup of wine. 

[Drink second cup of wine]

## Answering The 4 Questions

**Reader 1**: And now it is time to answer those four questions about what makes this night different from all other nights. 

**Reader 1**: Matzah--Why do we eat matzah? 

**Group**: *Matzah is the symbol of our affliction and our freedom.*

**Reader 2**: Legend has it that when Moses and his followers fled Egypt, they moved so quickly that the bread they baked did not have time to rise. 

**Reader 3**: However, scholars have noted that long before the Jews celebrated Passover, farmers of the Middle East celebrated KhagHa-matzot, the festival of unleavened bread, at this time of year. 

This was a festival where unleavened bread was made from the new grain harvest that took place at this time of the year. 

**Reader 4**: The old fermented dough was thrown out so that last year's grain would not be mixed with this year's. Therefore, the new season began with the eating of unleavened bread--matzah. Later on, the Jewish people incorporated this agricultural festival into the celebration of freedom and renewal we now call Passover. 

**Reader 2**: Let us all now eat a piece of matzah. 

**Reader 1**: Maror--Why do we eat maror, the bitter herb? 

**Group**: *Tradition says that this root is to remind us of the time of our slavery. We force ourselves to taste pain so that we may more readily value pleasure.* 

**Reader 2**: Scholars inform us that bitter herbs were eaten at the Spring festival in ancient times. The sharpness of the taste awakened the senses and made the people feel at one with nature's revival. Thus, maror is the stimulus of life, reminding us that struggle is better than the complacent acceptance of injustice. 

Let us all now take bitter herb and eat it. 

**Reader 3**: Salt Water--Why do we dip our food in salt water two times on this night? 

**Group**: *The first time, the salty taste reminds us of the tears we cried when we were slaves. The second time, the salt water and the green help us to remember the ocean and green plants and the Earth, from which we get air and water and food that enable us to live.*

[All dip parsley into salt water two times and eat it]

**Reader 4**: Leaning--Why do we eat while leaning on this night? 

**Reader 3**: This question goes back to ancient times in Rome, when it was the custom for rich people to eat while lying on a couch leaning on one elbow as slaves and servants fed them. The Jewish people thought of this relaxed type of eating as a sign of freedom and prosperity, so they would lean to one side eating at the Seder on Passover, the festival of freedom. Today, we who are free eat while sitting up, even at Passover, but the question remains in the service as a reminder of how it was when our people longed for freedom.

**Reader 1**: We have answered the four traditional questions, but there are still more questions to be answered. There are other special foods on our Seder plate: a sweet condiment (charoset), a roast lamb's bone (zeroah), and an egg (beitzah). Why are they here? 

Charoset--Why do we eat charoset? 

**Reader 2**: Apples, nuts, cinnamon, and wine are combined to make this sweet condiment. It is the color of clay or mortar. It reminds us of the bricks and mortar that the Israelites are said to have made when they built the Pharaohs' palaces and cities. At the same time, the taste of kharoset is sweet, and it reminds us of the sweetness of freedom. 

**Reader 2**: Let us now all eat kharoset on a piece of matzah. 

**Reader 3**: There is an interesting tradition to take a piece of matzah and place upon it some bitter herb (maror) and some charoset. As you eat this, the full meaning of Passover is felt through this combination. 

**Reader 1**: Zeroah means shankbone or thigh bone. This lamb's bone takes us back, once again, to ancient times to the shepherd's festival of Pesach. It was celebrated at the time of the full moon in the month the lambs and goats were born. At that time, each family would slaughter a young lamb or goat for a Spring feast.

**Reader 4**: Beitzah--Why do we eat egg?

**Reader 1**: Beitzah is the egg of life. Each of us begins as an egg and grows to adulthood. The egg reminds us of our evolutionary past and the gifts of human inheritance. But the egg is fragile. It represents potential that can be destroyed. Left alone, its life would perish. 

**Reader 4**: Growing life needs warmth and love and security, guidance, hope, and vision. To achieve their full potential, human beings need the support and encouragement of family and community. Eggs symbolize the fragility and interdependence of life. 

**Reader 5**: Orange – why is there an orange on the Seder plate when that was not part of any traditional Passover celebrations? 

**Reader 1**: The orange on the Seder plate is the result of an experience Professor Susannah Heschel had in the early 1980s. In her own words: 

“In the early 1980s, the Hillel Foundation invited me to speak on a panel at Oberlin College. While on campus, I came across a Haggada that had been written by some Oberlin students to express feminist concerns. One ritual they devised was placing a crust of bread on the Seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians ("there's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of bread on the Seder plate"). 

At the next Passover, I placed an orange on our family's Seder plate. During the first part of the Seder, I asked everyone to take a segment of the orange, make the blessing over fruit, and eat it as a gesture of solidarity with Jewish lesbians and gay men, and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community (I mentioned widows in particular).

When lecturing, I often mentioned my custom as one of many new feminist rituals that had been developed in the last twenty years. Somehow, though, the typical patriarchal maneuver occurred: 

My idea of an orange and my intention of affirming lesbians and gay men were transformed. Now the story circulates that a MAN stood up after a lecture I delivered and said to me, in anger, that a woman belongs on the bimah as much as an orange on the Seder plate. My idea, a woman's words, are attributed to a man, and the affirmation of lesbians and gay men is simply erased. Isn't that precisely what's happened over the centuries to women's ideas?”


## Breaking the Matzah

**Reader 2**: We have drunk the wine and tasted the special foods of the Passover celebration. They symbolize our attachment to the traditions of our culture, to freedom, and to life itself. Before we enjoy our feast, let us set aside the first of these symbols, the Matzah, to be the final food of this Passover supper, reminding us of why we are gathered here and what it is we celebrate. 

[Set some matzah aside, eat it last after desert]

## The third cup of wine

**Reader 2**: Let us all now fill our glasses with wine. During this festival of life, it is important for us to remember our lost sisters and brothers--the millions who died, alone and friendless, victims of genocide. Their anguish and death must be with us, even in our times of celebration. 

**Group**: *We resolve that their memory shall not be lost. We accept the responsibility of working to prevent such suffering from ever again occurring on this earth.* 

**Reader 5**: We drink the third cup of wine to those who were taken from us and to those who fought for freedom and life. 
[Drink third cup of wine]

**Reader 1**: Just as the food of our Passover supper has nourished our bodies, so the experience of the human spirit gives meaning to our lives. As a full expression of the hope and joy of this combination, we say Dayenu. 

**Around the table:**
```
If He had brought us out from Egypt,
and had not carried out judgments against them
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had carried out judgments against them,
and not against their idols
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had destroyed their idols,
and had not smitten their first-born
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had smitten their first-born,
and had not given us their wealth
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us their wealth,
and had not split the sea for us
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had split the sea for us,
and had not taken us through it on dry land
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had taken us through the sea on dry land,
and had not drowned our oppressors in it
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had drowned our oppressors in it,
and had not supplied our needs in the desert for forty years
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had supplied our needs in the desert for forty years,
and had not fed us the manna
```
```
If He had fed us the manna,
and had not given us the Shabbat
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us the Shabbat,
and had not brought us before Mount Sinai
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had brought us before Mount Sinai,
and had not given us the Torah	v'lo
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had given us the Torah,
and had not brought us into the land of Israel
```
**All Say:** Dayenu
```
If He had brought us into the land of Israel,
and not built for us the Holy Temple
```
**All Say:** Dayenu


## The cup of Elijah

**Reader 1**: Let us all fill our wine glasses. 

[Reader 1 picks up Elijah's cup, an extra glass of wine, for all to see.]

This is the cup of Elijah. Legend says that Elijah was a brave man who denounced the slavery of his day. He is a symbol of peace and freedom. 

It was customary during the Passover Seder to open the door of the house for Elijah, in the hope that the age of universal peace may soon be at hand. 

**Group**: *We, too, open the door to peace, knowing that Elijah's task is really our own. Only when we have made a world where nation shall not lift up sword against nation, where justice is universal, and where each person is free, will the age-old dream of peace be real.*

*Let us bring peace and justice to the world!*

**Reader 1**: Let us now open the door. 

[Open a door in your house, and leave it open while you eat]

We will now raise our glasses and say:

**Group:**
*We shall make peace in the world* 

*We shall make peace for ourselves* 

*And peace for all the world.*

[Drink 4th Glass Of Wine]

## Let's Eat

**Reader 1**: Now it is time for our leisurely, and scrumptious Pesach meal.
