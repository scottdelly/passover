## Invitation

**Guide**: We have come together this evening for many reasons. We are here because Spring is all around, the Earth is reborn, and it is a good time to celebrate with family and friends. 

**Simple Child**: The weather is getting warmer and the days are getting longer.

**Together:** *We are here because the struggle for freedom never stops. We are here to remember all those who are not free.*

**Family Matriarch**: [Light candles before the prayer]

ברוך אתה א-דני א-להינו מלך העולם, אשר קדשנו במצותיו, וצונו להדליק נר של שבת קדש

**Together**: *Baruch Atah Ado-nai, Elo-heinu Melech Ha-olam, Asher Kid’shanu B’mitzvotav V’tzivanu L’hadlik Ner Shel Yom Tov*

**Wise Child**: The light of these candles symbolizes a renewal of life, a reaffirmation of freedom.

# Kadesh — Kiddush, the first cup of wine

**Rabbi**: It is preferred that everyones's cup should be poured by someone else to symbolize the majesty of the evening. Each cup should be filled to the brim as a symbol of the abundance of the season!

**Host**: [Make sure the wine cups are filled]

**Rebellious Child**: Spring is the season of new growth and new life. Every living thing must either grow, or die; growth is a sign and a condition of life.

**Wise Child**: We grow as we achieve new insights, new knowledge, and new goals. Let's raise our cups to signify our gratitude for life, and for the joy of knowing inner growth, which gives life meaning.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן

**Together**: *Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, borei p’ri hagafen.*

# Urhatz – Wash

**Host**: [Each participant should wash their hands, even if only symbolically]

# Karpas — Spring vegetable

**Rabbi**: Any vegetable that is not bitter may be eaten. Common vegetables used are celery, parsley, onion, or potato. 

**Simple Child**: We dip the Karpas into the salt water to remind us that the Jews crossed the Red Sea

**Wise Child**: It's also a reminder of the baby boys cast in the Nile, and the tears shed by the slaves.

# Yahatz — Divide, Breaking the middle matzah

**Guide**:  Break the middle matzah into two parts. It should be broken by hand rather than cut. Wrap the larger part in napkin and save for the conclusion of the seder.

**Rabbi**: We can't finish the seder without the middle matzah. It's our dessert!

# Magid — Narrate

**Host**: [Make sure the wine cups are filled]

## The Seder Plate

**All around the table**:

> Zeroah - A Roasted Shank Bone
> 
> The roasted shank bone of a lamb reminds Jews of the 10th plague in Egypt when all firstborn Egyptians were killed. 
> During this plague, the Israelites marked the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a lamb so that when Death passed over Egypt, it would pass over their homes.

> Beitzah - A hard-boiled Egg
> 
> During the time of the Temple, a festival sacrifice was made and the roasted egg represents that meat offering.
> Additionally, hard boiled eggs were traditionally the first food served to mourners after a funeral, and thus the egg serves as a symbol of mourning for the loss of the two Temples.

> Maror - Bitter Herbs
> 
> Because the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, Jews eat bitter herbs to remind them of the harshness of servitude.

> Charoset
> 
> The word charoset comes from the Hebrew word cheres, meaning clay.
> It represents the mortar that the Israelites were forced to use while they built structures for their Egyptian taskmasters. 

> Karpas - Fresh, raw vegetable
> 
> The vegetation of spring.

> Chazeret - Bitter Vegetable
> 
> This piece of the seder plate also symbolizes the bitterness of slavery.
> It also fulfills the requirement called korech, which is when the maror is eaten together with matzah

> Orange
> 
> The orange represents inclusiveness in Judaism, specifically women, and the LGBTQ+ community

## The Four Questions (+1)

**Youngest Person**: 
```
מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה, הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת
Mah nishtanah, ha-laylah ha-zeh, mi-kol ha-leylot
Why is this night different from all other nights? 

שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה, כֻּלּוֹ מַצָּה 
She-b'khol ha-leylot 'anu 'okhlin chameytz u-matzah,
ha-laylah ha-zeh, kulo matzah
On all other nights we eat either bread or matzah. 
Why, on this night, do we eat only matzah? 
```

**Simple Child**: Legend has it that when Moses and his followers fled Egypt, they moved so quickly that the bread they baked did not have time to rise. 

**Rabbi**: Scholars have noted that long before the Jews celebrated Passover, farmers of the Middle East celebrated KhagHa-matzot, the festival of unleavened bread, at this time of year. This was a festival where unleavened bread was made from the new grain harvest that took place at this time of the year. 

**Rebellious Child**: The old fermented dough was thrown out so that last year's grain would not be mixed with this year's. Therefore, the new season began with the eating of unleavened bread--matzah. Later on, the Jewish people incorporated this agricultural festival into the celebration of freedom and renewal we now call Passover. 

**Youngest Person**: 
```
שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין שְׁאָר יְרָקוֹת הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה, מָרוֹר 
She-b'khol ha-leylot 'anu 'okhlin sh'ar y'rakot,
ha-laylah ha-zeh, maror
On all other nights we eat herbs of any kind.
Why, on this night, do we eat only bitter herbs?
```

**Simple Child**: Tradition says that this root is to remind us of the time of our slavery. We force ourselves to taste pain so that we may more readily value pleasure.

**Rabbi**: Scholars inform us that bitter herbs were eaten at the Spring festival in ancient times. The sharpness of the taste awakened the senses and made the people feel at one with nature's revival. Thus, maror is the stimulus of life, reminding us that struggle is better than the complacent acceptance of injustice. 

**Youngest Person**: 
```
שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אֵין אָנוּ מַטְבִּילִין אֲפִילוּ פַּעַם אֶחָת הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה, שְׁתֵּי פְעָמִים
She-b'khol ha-leylot 'eyn 'anu matbilin 'afilu pa'am 'achat,
ha-laylah ha-zeh, shtey p'amim
On all other nights, we do not dip our herbs even once.
Why, on this night, do we dip them twice? 
```
**Simple Child**: The first time, the salty taste reminds us of the tears we cried when we were slaves. 

**Wise Child**: The second time, the salt water reminds us of when we crossed the red sea.

**Youngest Person**: 
```
שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין בֵּין יוֹשְׁבִין וּבֵין מְסֻבִּין הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה, כֻּלָּנוּ מְסֻבִּין
She-b'khol ha-leylot 'anu 'okhlin beyn yoshvin u-veyn m'subin,
ha-laylah ha-zeh, kulanu m'subin
On all other nights, we eat either sitting or leaning.
Why, on this night, do we eat while leaning? 
```

**Rebelious Child**: This goes back to ancient times in Rome, when it was the custom for rich people to eat while lying on a couch leaning on one elbow as slaves and servants fed them. 

**Wise Child**: The Jewish people thought of this relaxed type of eating as a sign of freedom and prosperity, so they would lean to one side eating at the Seder on Passover, the festival of freedom. 

**Rabbi**: Today, we who are free eat while sitting up, even at Passover, but the question remains in the service as a reminder of how it was when our people longed for freedom.

## The Ten Plagues

**Simple Child**: Since our cup cannot be regarded as full when we recall the suffering of the Egyptians, a drop of wine is removed from the cup with the mention of each plague.

[As each plague is named, everyone dips a finger in wine and then touches a plate to remove the drop.]

**Together**: *Blood, Frogs, Gnats, Flies, Cattle Disease, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, Death of the Firstborn.* 

**Rebellious Child**: In the same spirit, our celebration today is also shadowed by our awareness of continuing sorrow and oppression in all parts of the world. Ancient plagues are mirrored in modern tragedies. 

**Wise Child**: We are all victims together of enormous social problems. We share in their effects and in the responsibility to overcome them. 

**Rabbi**: We spill wine from our cups at the mention of each of these contemporary plagues. We cannot allow ourselves to drink a full measure since our own lives are sobered by these ills, which darken our lives and diminish our joy. As the pain of others diminishes our joys, let us once more diminish the wine of our festival as we repeat the names of these modern plagues: 

**Together**: *Hunger, War, Crime, Disease, Racism, Abuse, Poverty, Homophobia, Pollution, Indifference to suffering.* 

**Simple Child**: May there be peace, kindness, happiness, and compassion. 

## Dayenu

**Rabbi**: Dayenu is about gratitude and thanksgiving. We acknowledge 15 major Biblical events and proclaim after each event: “It would have been enough!”

**All around the table**:
```
If He had brought us out from Egypt,
and had not carried out judgments against them
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had carried out judgments against them,
and not against their idols
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had destroyed their idols,
and had not smitten their first-born
```
**Together**: Dayenu
```
If He had smitten their first-born,
and had not given us their wealth
```
**Together:** Dayenu!
```
If He had given us their wealth,
and had not split the sea for us
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had split the sea for us,
and had not taken us through it on dry land
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had taken us through the sea on dry land,
and had not drowned our oppressors in it
```
**Together**: Dayenu
```
If He had drowned our oppressors in it,
and had not supplied our needs in the desert for forty years
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had supplied our needs in the desert for forty years,
and had not fed us the manna
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had fed us the manna,
and had not given us the Shabbat
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had given us the Shabbat,
and had not brought us before Mount Sinai
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had brought us before Mount Sinai,
and had not given us the Torah	v'lo
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had given us the Torah,
and had not brought us into the land of Israel
```
**Together**: Dayenu!
```
If He had brought us into the land of Israel,
and not built for us the Holy Temple
```
**Together**: Dayenu!

## The second cup of wine

**Rebellious Child**: “Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time: the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence. Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” 

— Martin Luther King Jr, Nobel Prize Speech 1964.

**Wise Child**: The second cup of wine is dedicated not only to the struggles of the Jewish people, but to all people seeking a secure life free of fear and persecution. In particular, may the Israelis and the Palestinians come to enjoy freedom and peace. For, as the prophet Isaiah said:

**Together**: *They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again know war.*

## The Story Of Passover

**Reader 1**: Passover is a celebration of Life. Despite many centuries of destruction our hearts are tempered by the knowledge that the world can also be good. We have endured slavery and genocide. But we have also enjoyed freedom and power. 

**Reader 2**: It is said that long ago, during a time of famine, the ancient Israelites traveled to Egypt. According to this legend, the Israelites at that time were all in a single family - Jacob and his children. 
 
**Reader 3**: One of Jacob's sons was Joseph. He was so wise that the ruler of Egypt - the Pharaoh - made Joseph a leader over all the people of Egypt.
 
**Reader 4**: But as time passed, another Pharaoh became the ruler of Egypt. He did not remember about Joseph and his wise leadership. He became fearful of the growing Isrealite population. This new Pharaoh turned the Israelites into slaves.
 
**Reader 5**: After the Israelites were in Egypt for over 400 years, a man arose among them. He demanded that Pharaoh let his people go! Many times he risked his life to insist on the freedom of his people, until he finally succeeded. 
 
**Reader 6**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and the people he led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We celebrate the struggle of all people to be free.  Throughout the centuries, the story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt has inspired Jews and non-Jews in times of persecution and hardship. 

**Reader 7**: The thirst for freedom exists in all people. Many centuries after the time of Moses, African people were brought to America as slaves. The freedom we celebrate tonight is not only freedom from slavery. It is also the freedom to live in peace, with dignity and with hope for a bright future.

**Reader 8**: This evening, as we celebrate our own freedom, be aware of the struggle for freedom in many other parts of the world. 

**Reader 9**: “When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always.” 

— Gandhi

# Rohtza — Wash

**Guide**: Ready to eat, the hands are washed before the meal, as is required at any meal.

# Motzi Matzah — Eating Matzah

**Guide**: The first food at the meal is the matzah, the unleavened bread. The usual blessing over bread, Hamotzi, is recited. However, before eating the matzah, a second blessing thanking God for the requirement to eat matzah is recited.

# Maror — Bitter Herbs

**Guide**: Small pieces of horseradish are dipped into haroset (a sweet paste symbolic of mortar) to indicate that overemphasis on material things results in bitterness. Some people mix ground horseradish with charoset. Do not recline while eating the marror.

# Korekh — Hillel Sandwich

**Rabbi**: In ancient times, the Talmudic scholar Hillel ate the three symbolic foods (lamb, matzah, and bitter herbs) together so that each mouthful contained all three. Thus the symbols of slavery and liberation were intermingled. Now that we do not have the Paschal lamb, we eat just the matzah and horseradish in a “Hillel sandwich.” No special blessing is said, but we do read the words recalling Hillel’s practice.

## The third cup of wine

**Host**: [Make sure the wine cups are filled]

**Simple Child**: We drink the third cup of wine to those who were taken from us and to those who fought for freedom and life.

**Rebellious Child**: During this festival of life, it is important for us to remember our lost sisters and brothers--the millions who died, alone and friendless, victims of genocide. Their anguish and death must be with us, even in our times of celebration. 

**Together**: *Their memory shall not be lost.* 

[Drink third cup of wine]

# Shulhan Orekh — Meal


# Tzafun — Dessert

**Rabbi**: This reminds us of the passover sacrifice made at the temple. Like that sacrifice, it is eaten at the end of the meal, when we have already satisfied our hunger because we do not eat this for sustenance.

# Barekh — Grace After Meals (Birkat Hamazon)

## The cup of Elijah

**Host**: [Filll the wine cups and a cup for Elijah and Ruth]

**Simple Child**:  At Passover we fill a cup with wine for Elijah and open the door to welcome him to our seder. Elijah symbolizes our hope for the Messianic age, when the world will be perfected, and all people will live in harmony and peace.

**Rebellious Child**: We also fill a cup of wine for Ruth, the first Jew by choice and great-grandmother of King David. We open the door to signify our welcome of Ruth and all who follow in her footsteps—those who become part of our people, part of our diversity.

**Together**: *We, too, open the door to peace, knowing that Elijah's task is really our own.*

**Wise Child**: Only when we have made a world where nation shall not lift up sword against nation, where justice is universal, and where each person is free, will the age-old dream of peace be real.*

**Together**: *Let us bring peace and justice to the world!*

**Host**: [Open a door for Elijah]

[Drink 4th Glass Of Wine]

# Hallel — Psalms of Praise

**Guide**: The rest of the evening is given over to hymns and songs. The Hallel is completed, and all join in singing songs: Adir Hu, Had Gadya, etc.

# Nirtzah — Conclusion 

**Guide**: I hope we all had a great Seder, it's time to bring this to a close.

**Together**: Next Year in Jerusalem!
